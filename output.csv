Libraries don't always collect non-fiction in enough depth, and non-fiction collection development is not coordinated across the system - so holds don't always work to get what you need.

Do a whole-county newsletter that points out exactly how we are fulfilling our mission.  What exactly do we mean by ""preparing our community for a bright future?""

What does that mean, and are all libraries on the same page as to what the opportunities are?  I am NOT saying that all libraries need to be identical, but I am saying we need to be closer so that substantial progress towards OCPL goals are happening in every library.  Some libraries (smaller) are going to need more support making that happen.  We need a more diverse staff in all areas.  We need to talk with community groups like Focus Greater Syracuse to get different ideas.  We need to really check the ""vocational awe!""

","At NOPL North Syracuse there are multiple shelves stuffed with certain authors. As an example, James Patterson takes up almost three full shelves in the large print section. At NOPL Cicero today, I saw four and a half shelves filled with James Patterson large print books. Couldn't there be a way to coordinate on the number of titles between branches so that perhaps there would be space to order some of the other books that are in large print and written by other authors.

Teach staff about what ""customer service"" means.   I previously worked several years at NOPL North Syracuse. We would greet everyone who came into the library so they knew they were welcome and that we notices them. Most often we got to know them by name. This helps people to feel seen. It's a common practice in the majority of retail shops. In the last seven years I have noticed a huge drop in customer service. No one greets you. No one smiles. No one interacts with you. Instead of feeling like you have entered a ""community centered environment"" you feel like you're not welcome. I've been to many of the city and suburban branches and the majority of them are as I describe... unfriendly, unwelcoming and act as though you are disturbing them when you do take the chance to approach them. To me... this is the saddest aspect of libraries today. ",Good,Being able to borrow books in a variety of formats. ,I have lots of ideas. To many to list here.
